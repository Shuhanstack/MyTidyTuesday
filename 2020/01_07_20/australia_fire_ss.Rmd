### Map the Australia fires

Method based on [link](https://gist.github.com/deanmarchiori/cb64f105eb0f6204eaa88323eaa29fdb) by Dean Marchiori

```{r}

url <- "http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/feeds/majorIncidents.json"

fires <- st_read(url)

fire_poly <- fires %>% 
  st_buffer(dist = 0) %>% 
  st_union(by_feature = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
mapview(fire_poly, legend = FALSE, col.regions = "red", color = "gray")

# Get the Data
